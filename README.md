## 🧭 Project Overview

This repository presents an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the **Spotify music dataset**, uncovering how audio features like **energy**, **valence**, **tempo**, and **danceability** contribute to a song’s popularity.
The analysis captures how sound characteristics reflect listeners’ preferences and shape modern music trends.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To analyze Spotify’s audio features and explore how different musical elements influence a track’s **popularity** and **listener engagement**.

## 📂 Repository Contents

**Files included:**

* `spotify_tracks.csv` – Main dataset containing audio features of tracks.
* `spotify_data_description.csv` – Column-wise description of all variables.
* `Spotify1(1).ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with full exploratory analysis and visualizations.
* `spotify_dataset_presentation.pdf` – Final project presentation summarizing results and visual insights.

**Key Features:**
`track_name`, `artist_name`, `year`, `popularity`, `danceability`, `energy`, `valence`, `tempo`, `instrumentalness`, `liveness`, etc.

---

## 🔍 Analysis Highlights

* Conducted **Univariate and Bivariate Analysis** to examine distributions and feature relationships.
* Explored how **energy**, **valence (positivity)**, **instrumentalness**, **tempo**, and **liveness** correlate with popularity.
* Visualized insights through scatter plots, box plots, and violin plots for deeper interpretation.
* Included **language-wise and mode-wise analysis** to uncover cultural and tonal trends in music.

---

## 💡 Key Insights

* Tracks with higher **valence (happiness)** show a slight tendency toward higher popularity.
* **Tempo** has minimal effect — both slow and fast songs can become popular.
* **Instrumentalness** is negatively correlated with popularity — vocal tracks dominate the charts.
* Songs in **major keys** are more **danceable**, aligning with mainstream upbeat trends.
* **Liveness** shows a weak negative link — studio recordings outperform live versions in popularity.
* Overall, **audio features alone can’t predict popularity**; factors like **artist fame, marketing, and playlisting** play major roles.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

* **Python 🐍**
* **Pandas**, **NumPy** – Data handling and preprocessing
* **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** – Visualization and trend analysis
* **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive data exploration

---

## 📊 Future Scope

* Build predictive models using **machine learning** to estimate track popularity.
* Extend analysis with **genre classification** and **temporal trends** (by year or decade).
* Integrate **sentiment analysis of lyrics** for deeper emotional mapping.
