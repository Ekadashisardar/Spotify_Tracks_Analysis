**Exploring the Science Behind Music Popularity with Data & Rhythm**
by **Ekadashi Sardar (Team DataMinds)**

## 🧭 Project Overview

This repository presents an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the **Spotify music dataset**, uncovering how audio features like **energy**, **valence**, **tempo**, and **danceability** contribute to a song’s popularity.
The project dives deep into how sound characteristics reflect listeners’ preferences and shape modern music trends.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To analyze Spotify’s audio features and explore the relationship between different sound attributes and track popularity.

---

## 📂 Dataset Details

**Files included:**

* `spotify_tracks.csv` – Main dataset containing audio features of tracks.
* `spotify_data_description.csv` – Column-wise description of all variables.
* `Spotify1(1).ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook for analysis and visualizations.

**Key Features:**

* `track_name`, `artist_name`, `year`, `popularity`, `danceability`, `energy`, `valence`, `tempo`, `instrumentalness`, `liveness`, etc.

---

## 🔍 Analysis Highlights

* **Univariate & Bivariate Analysis** performed to understand distributions and relationships.
* Explored how **energy**, **valence (positivity)**, **instrumentalness**, **tempo**, and **liveness** relate to track popularity.
* Generated multiple visualizations to interpret insights clearly and effectively.

---

## 💡 Key Insights

* Tracks with higher **valence** (happier tone) tend to be slightly more popular.
* **Tempo** shows minimal effect — both slow and fast songs can be hits.
* **Instrumentalness** has a negative relation — vocal tracks dominate the charts.
* Higher **liveness** often corresponds to lower popularity, favoring studio-produced music.
* Overall, **audio features alone don’t determine popularity** — external factors like artist fame and marketing also play major roles.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

* Python 🐍
* Pandas, NumPy
* Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📊 Future Scope

* Build predictive models for popularity using regression or machine learning.
* Include genre-based analysis for deeper insights.
* Compare patterns across different decades.
